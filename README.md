Secret File Vault

Overview
This Python script provides a robust, user-friendly solution for securely storing sensitive files. Utilizing encryption and a master password, it ensures data confidentiality while offering flexible access through command-line and graphical user interfaces.

Features
* Strong Encryption:Employs advanced encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) to protect file contents.
* Master Password Protection:Requires a strong, user-defined master password for vault access.
* File Management: Easily add, delete, and view hidden files within the vault.
* Optional Encryption: Users can choose to encrypt files individually for added security.
* Intuitive GUI: User-friendly graphical interface for seamless interaction.
* Versatile Command-Line: Command-line options for advanced users and scripting.

Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/secret-file-vault.git
   
2. **Install dependencies:**
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

Usage
Command-Line
To use the command-line interface, run the `secret_vault.py` script with the following options:
* `-a`: Add a file to the vault
* `-d`: Delete a file from the vault
* `-l`: List files in the vault
* `-h`: Display help information

Example:
bash
python secret_vault.py -a path/to/file


GUI
To use the graphical user interface, run the `create_secret_vault_gui()` function from the `secret_vault.py` script. The GUI provides an intuitive way to interact with the vault, including file selection, encryption options, and file management.

Security Considerations
* **Master Password Strength:** Choose a complex master password to enhance security.
* **Encryption Algorithm:** Use strong, well-established encryption algorithms.
* **Regular Updates:** Keep the project and its dependencies up-to-date with security patches.
* **Backup:** Regularly back up the vault to prevent data loss.
* **Caution:** Avoid storing highly sensitive data that requires the highest level of security.

Limitations
* The vault's security relies on the strength of the master password and the encryption algorithm.
* The GUI might have limited functionality compared to the command-line interface.

Contributing
Contributions to improve the project are welcome. Please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Additional Notes
* Consider adding unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
* Explore options for cloud storage integration or remote access.
* Implement features for file versioning or recovery.
* Enhance the GUI with progress bars, error handling, and informative messages.

By incorporating these elements, you can create a comprehensive and secure secret file vault application.
